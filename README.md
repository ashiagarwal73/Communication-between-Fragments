# Communication Between Fragment to Fragment or Fragment to Activity
To pass data from a fragment to calling activity we need to write a callback method for it -
this is done by creating a interface inside a fragment and the implementing its menthods in the activity  and then when we call the funcion inside a fragment it wil be directed to the implementation of that fragment in the activity.The code for this concept is shown in demo also to communicate from one fragment to another first we have o send data to the activity and then actiivty will call the methods of other fragment and pass data as arguments.
